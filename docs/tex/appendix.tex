\section*{Appendix}

\subsection*{Future Work}

\Mbrace{} is a large project that faces multiple technical challenges. As such,
it remains (as of the private alpha release) a work in progress with many important
features still under development. In this section we discuss some of the features
which we consider to be important milestones in the future of the \mbrace{} project.

\subsubsection*{\csharp{}-LINQ support}

One of the most mission critical TODOs for the \mbrace{} project is providing an idiomatic 
API for the immensely popular \csharp{} language. We plan to offer this in the
form of a LINQ provider%
\footnote{\samehref{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb397926.aspx}}
for data parallelism. This would allow building cloud workflows using simple
LINQ-style queries:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=CSharp]
var result =  from c in Customers.ToCloud()
			  where c.City == "Athens"
			  orderby c.Name
			  select c.Name, c.City
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{Mono Support}

The Mono project%
\footnote{The Mono project, \samehref{http://www.mono-project.com/}.}
is a popular open source implementation of Microsoft's \dotnet{} framework.
The Mono framework is in the unique position of offering a truly cross-platform
\dotnet{} development experience as it supports most major operating systems,
including Linux and Mac OS X.

Just like the \fsharp{} language itself, we believe that a big part of \mbrace{}'s 
future lies with Mono and the open source community in general. Providing support
for the Mono framework is strategically important since it opens up the market
to diverse developer cultures and data center infrastructures.
